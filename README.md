# Water Bill Payment Tool

This tool is used to automatically pay my water bill

This tool uses all local data and makes the requests from the local machine. The property information is stored directly in the code.

It should match the data in this file `properties.json`.

Run the script using this command `python /Users/kd/Desktop/projects/water-bill-automation/main.py`
